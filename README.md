# Warped by GroundZero

## -------- GAME INFO --------

Warped is a platformer game developed by two students at Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya for the Game Development subject. As of collisions with the environment, the player can walk left or right, jump, and if it falls on a pit, it's sent to the start of the level. The game reads the map and most of the gameplay values from .xml files, and .tmx files generated via Tiled.

DISCLAIMER: The tileset used in this game is copyright free (credit to ansimuz, tileset URL: https://ansimuz.itch.io/warped-caves). 
The tileset was edited in Adobe Photoshopc so the original work wont have as many elements in the tileset as ours.
The sprites used for the main character are taken from the 2007 game "Mega Man ZX Advent", developed 
by Inti Creates and published by Capcom. We do not own the rights for these sprites, nor we 		
claim to have made them. All rights belong to Capcom.

###	--!!INNOVATION!!--

For innovation (doing something that the assignment didn't require), we developed a system that can read all the animations of the player from a .tmx file, so that 		
animations can later be easily edited from Tiled. The number of animations the player has, and their names, still has to be specified in the code, 
but all pushbacks (frame data) are read from the .tmx, and a designer can modify the .png spritesheet, and then set the animations from Tiled.

###	-- Controls --

- A and D: 	Move the character left or right.

- J:		Jump. By inputting again in midair, the player can double-jump once before touching ground again.

#### -- Debug Features --

- F1:		Start again from the first level of the game.
- F2:		Start again from the beginning of the current level.
- F5:		Save current state of the game. (save file: "save_game.xml")
- F6:		Load state from earlier save.
- F9:		See colliders/hitboxes.
- F10:		Godmode (can walk over pits, can double jump limitless, character changes visually).
